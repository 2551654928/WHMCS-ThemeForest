==============================================
1. Upload the "Hostinza" folder to your WHMCS /templates Folder

2. Activate "Hostinza" Template from WHMCS Admin Panel Setup

3. Refresh the Client Area

Notes
==============================================

To update the WHMCS template Header and footer, Open header.tpl and footer.tpl inside "Hostinza" folder and edit accordingly your need. All the css overrides in css/custom.css file.
You can also copy paste from the HTML page to match with your website and update the links.

If you like to rename WHMCS template folder name and also orderform folder name, just use only letters and numbers (according to WHMCS).

For example "Hostinza" is OK. But "Hostin-za" is not Valid (WHMCS will be unable to see the specific template in admin).
