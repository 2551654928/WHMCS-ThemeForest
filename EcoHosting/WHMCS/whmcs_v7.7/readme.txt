Notes
==============================================

To update the WHMCS template Header and footer, Open "header.tpl" and "footer.tpl" inside "/EcoHostingWP" folder and edit accordingly. All of the css overrides in "css/ecohosting-style.css" file. If you need to add custom CSS, then add your custom CSS in "custom.css" file.


If you like to rename WHMCS template folder name and also orderform folder name, just use only letters and numbers (according to WHMCS).
For example "myhost" is OK. But "my-host" is not OK (WHMCS will be unable to see the specific template in admin).
